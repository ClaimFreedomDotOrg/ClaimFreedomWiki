# Applied Interoception

**Duration**: 1–3 minutes, many times daily

**Level**: Beginner → Advanced (scales with sensitivity)

**Goal**: Detect activation early by training precise, kind awareness of body signals (jaw, breath, chest, belly, shoulders), so you can befriend the dragon before narrative ignition and choose values-aligned action.

> Interoception is how the Listener feels the kingdom in real time.

## The Practice

Do this micro-check 3–12+ times per day (on the hour, before meetings, after triggers, pre-sleep):

1. Pause and Name (3 seconds)
   - "Micro-scan." (say it silently)
2. Jaw (3 seconds)
   - Notice clenching/pressure. Let the tongue rest on the floor of the mouth; soften.
3. Breath (6 seconds)
   - Feel the next inhale. Then lengthen the exhale by 1–2 seconds. Repeat once.
4. Chest / Heart (6 seconds)
   - Sense tightness/heat/pressure. Place a hand if soothing. Allow, don't fix.
5. Belly / Solar Plexus (6 seconds)
   - Notice knots/butterflies/emptiness. Breathe into the back of the body.
6. Shoulders / Back (6 seconds)
   - Clock tension/elevation. Drop 1%. Let gravity help.
7. Label (3 seconds)
   - One word: "tight / hot / buzzy / flat / open." No story.
8. Invite (3 seconds)
   - "Thank you, Guardian. You can stand with me." (compassionate phrase)
9. Align (3–30 seconds)
   - Ask: "What is needed now?" Take one small values-consistent action (sip water, send one-line reply, step outside, breathe again).

Total: ~30–60 seconds. Repeat often; frequency beats duration.

## What You're Training

### Neurologically

- Interoceptive accuracy (insula)
- Salience calibration (ACC): distinguishing signal vs noise
- Parasympathetic tone via extended exhale; vagal regulation
- Early detection before `DMN` narrative escalation

### Philosophically

- Befriending the dragon (defensive energy) through non-violence
- Dis-identification from story by privileging sensation-first data
- Re-enshrining the Listener as sovereign through embodied presence

## Common Experiences

- "I don't feel anything at first" — Great. You're calibrating. Keep it simple and brief.
- "I feel more tension when I look" — Noticing reveals what's there. Meet it with warmth; reduce intensity if flooded.
- "My mind keeps narrating" — Label once ("thinking") and return to the body.
- "I forget to do it" — Pair with anchors (opening apps, hydration, bathroom, doorways, calendar alerts).

## Integration

- Stack after triggers: email conflict, social media spike, difficult convo.
- Embed in transitions: before/after meetings, commute, before sleep/after waking.
- Pair with phrases: "Micro-scan" (start), "Thank you, Guardian" (befriend), "One small action" (align).
- Track with a tiny checkbox grid; aim for consistency, not perfection.

### Safety & Scope

- This is not medical advice. If you have trauma history and experience overwhelm, consider support from a qualified therapist. Go gently; shorten steps.
