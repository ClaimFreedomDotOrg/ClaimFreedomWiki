# Body as Anchor

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes daily

**Level**: Beginner-Intermediate

**Goal**: Anchor awareness in the timeless present moment, breaking the DMN's time-bound narrative of rumination (past) and anxiety (future).

## Why the Body?

The hijacked DMN pulls consciousness into:

- **Past** → rumination, regret, trauma loops
- **Future** → anxiety, catastrophic projections

The body exists **only in the present moment**. It is the antidote to time-travel.

## The Practice

### 1. Arrive

Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes.

Take three slow, conscious breaths—noticing the breath moving in and out.

### 2. Scan for Sensations

Slowly bring attention to physical sensations, starting from the top of your head and moving down:

- **Head**: Tingling, pressure, warmth
- **Face**: Tension in jaw, eyes, forehead
- **Neck and shoulders**: Tightness, heaviness
- **Chest**: Rising and falling with breath, heartbeat
- **Belly**: Expanding and contracting
- **Legs and feet**: Contact with surface, temperature, pulsing

Don't change anything. Just **notice**.

### 3. Anchor in One Sensation

Choose one sensation to rest your attention on:

- The breath moving in and out of the nostrils
- The rise and fall of the belly
- The feeling of your hands resting on your lap

Let this become your **anchor**—a place to return to.

### 4. Notice When the Voice Hijacks You

Inevitably, the voice will pull you into thought:

- "I'm anxious about tomorrow's meeting."
- "I shouldn't have said that yesterday."
- "Am I doing this right?"

**This is the hijacking.** The DMN is pulling you out of the present.

### 5. Return to the Anchor

When you notice you've been lost in thought (even if it's been several minutes), gently return attention to your chosen bodily sensation.

Say internally: "Thinking. Returning to breath/body."

No judgment. No frustration. Just return.

### 6. Ask the Key Question

Periodically, as you rest in body sensations, ask:

> *"The voice says 'I am anxious.' But what is actually here, right now, in this body?"*

Usually, the body just **is**—breathing, pulsing, present. The catastrophe is in the voice, not in the body.

## What You're Training

**Neurologically**: Strengthening the **Task-Positive Network** (executive control) and **interoceptive awareness**, disengaging from DMN rumination loops.

**Philosophically**: You're practicing **presence**—the state in which the Divine Spark exists eternally. The "loop of hell" (Samsara) is time-bound; the body is timeless.

## Common Experiences

### "I feel intense emotions when I focus on my body."

The body holds emotions. When you bring awareness to it, suppressed feelings may surface (grief, anger, fear). This is **not** a problem—it's the body releasing what was stored.

If overwhelming, return to a neutral sensation (like hands or feet). Consider working with a trauma-informed therapist.

### "I get restless or bored."

Restlessness is the DMN saying, "This is pointless. Let's think about something more interesting." Boredom is a thought. Notice it: "Boredom is arising." Return to the body.

### "I fall asleep."

If lying down, try sitting. If exhausted, rest is what you need. Otherwise, open eyes slightly or focus on a more alert posture.

## Integration: Body Check-Ins

Throughout the day:

- **Set a timer** (every hour) to pause and notice three body sensations
- **Before eating**: Feel hunger, taste, chewing—anchor in the sensory experience
- **When triggered** (anxious, angry): "What does this feel like in my body?" (chest tightness, belly knot, etc.)

## Next Steps

Combine with:

- [Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice) — Alternate or integrate with body awareness
- [Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon) — Compassionately work with difficult sensations/emotions
