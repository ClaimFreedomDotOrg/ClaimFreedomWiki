# Working with Trauma

**Duration**: 5–20 minutes (modular)  
**Level**: Intermediate (with professional support as needed)  
**Goal**: Engage trauma-related material safely with grounding, titration, and compassion—without bypassing or re-traumatization

## Safety First

This page is trauma-informed guidance—not therapy. It complements, not replaces, professional care.

- If you experience suicidal ideation, dissociation, panic, or flashbacks, stop and contact a licensed clinician or crisis service.
- Pair this practice with therapy modalities like EMDR, IFS, somatic therapies (SE, SP), or trauma-focused CBT when indicated.
- Proceed gently. Less is more. Your system sets the pace.

> The aim is not to relive trauma but to relate to it differently—safely, in manageable doses—while resting as the Listener.

## Core Principles (Trauma-Informed)

- Window of Tolerance: Stay within a range where you can feel and remain present. If you move toward hyperarousal (panic/overwhelm) or hypoarousal (numb/collapsed), shift to grounding.
- Titration: Touch difficult material in tiny amounts; then return to safety. Repeat gradually.
- Pendulation: Gently move attention between activation (difficult sensation) and resource (safety/neutrality) to build capacity.
- Resourcing: Strengthen safety anchors first (body, environment, trusted people, imagery) before approaching traumatic content.
- Choice and Consent: You are in charge. You can pause, stop, or switch to resource at any moment.

## The Practice

Build in this order. Do not skip steps.

### 1) Resource and Ground (2–5 minutes)

- Orient: Look around the room. Name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear.
- Anchor: Feel feet on floor, sit-bones on chair, breath in belly.
- Stabilize: Place a hand on heart/belly. Lengthen the exhale slightly.
- Choose a resource: Memory of a safe place or caring figure; or a present-time neutral sensation (texture, warmth) you can return to.

Only proceed if you feel at least somewhat steady and present.

### 2) Establish the Witness (1–2 minutes)

- Silently ask: "Am I that voice... or the one listening?"  
- Name the present state without judgment: "Tension is here." "Numbness is here." "Anxiety is here."
- Keep connection to your resource while witnessing.

### 3) Micro-Titration with Pendulation (2–8 minutes)

- Touch: Bring 5–10% attention to a manageable edge of the difficult sensation (not the story). Where is it in the body? Quality (tight, hot, buzzing)?
- Step back: Return to the resource for 20–30 seconds. Feel safety/neutrality.
- Repeat: Touch (briefly) → Resource → Touch → Resource. Let the system unwind at its pace.
- Name what changes: "The tightness softened from 8/10 to 6/10." "Buzzing moved from chest to throat."

If intensity spikes, stop touching and remain with resource until settled.

### 4) Boundaries and Containment (as needed)

- Container: Imagine placing the material into a sealed, safe container you can revisit with a therapist.
- Time-box: Set a timer (e.g., 2 minutes) for touching the edge, then switch back to resource.
- Distance: Visualize the memory/image farther away (e.g., across the room, behind glass).

### 5) Closure and Downshift (2–5 minutes)

- Shake out arms/legs; stretch; sip water.  
- Re-orient to the room; name colors/textures; step outside if helpful.  
- End with gratitude toward the part of you that protects you: "Thank you for trying to keep me safe. You can rest now."

## What You're Training

### Neurologically

- Increasing vagal tone and parasympathetic regulation via grounding and exhale-lengthening
- Building prefrontal–limbic integration by toggling attention (pendulation)  
- Reducing DMN fusion with trauma narratives by keeping attention in somatic present-time experience

### Philosophically

- Honoring the wound without becoming the wound (Listener holds, Voice narrates)
- Compassionate relationship with protective parts ("the dragon") rather than war
- Re-claiming sovereignty through choice, pacing, and consent

## Common Experiences

- "I can only feel numbness."  
  Stay with neutral sensation (contact points, temperature). Numbness is an experience; witness it gently.
- "It gets overwhelming fast."  
  Reduce dose: Shorter touches, longer resourcing. Consider practicing only steps 1–2 for a while.
- "Memories intrude when I try to sleep."  
  Use containment imagery before bed; place material in a safe container with a plan to revisit in therapy.
- "I feel shame while practicing."  
  Name it; bring compassion to the part that learned shame as protection. Return to resource.

## Integration

- Pair with daily grounding from **[Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor)**.  
- Use **[Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration)** to check arousal level and re-center.  
- When stable, explore **[Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon)** to transform the inner stance from war to care.

## Red Flags: Pause and Seek Support

- Frequent dissociation (time loss, derealization, depersonalization)
- Panic attacks that do not settle with grounding
- Self-harm urges or suicidal ideation
- Flashbacks you cannot contain

If any appear, stop formal work and contact a trauma-informed clinician. Safety first.

## Next Steps

- Consider working with a therapist trained in EMDR, IFS, Somatic Experiencing, or Sensorimotor Psychotherapy.  
- Read more about the neurobiology of trauma (forthcoming neuroscience page).  
- Continue strengthening the core inquiry: "Am I this story, or the awareness holding it?"
