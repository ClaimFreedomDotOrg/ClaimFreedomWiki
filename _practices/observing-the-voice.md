# Observing the Voice

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes daily

**Level**: Beginner

**Goal**: Create separation between the Voice (DMN chatter, narrative Ego) and the Listener (Divine Spark, pure awareness).

## The Practice

### 1. Settle

Find a quiet space. Sit comfortably with your back upright but not rigid. Close your eyes or soften your gaze.

### 2. Notice the Voice

Bring attention to the "voice in your head"—the stream of thoughts, commentary, plans, worries, judgments.

Don't try to stop it. Don't fight it. Simply **observe** it as you would watch clouds passing in the sky.

### 3. Label It

When you notice thinking happening, silently label it:

- "There is thinking." (Not "I am thinking")
- "Planning is happening."
- "Worrying is occurring."

This subtle shift in language creates **distance** between you (the observer) and the thoughts (objects being observed).

### 4. Find the Listener

After labeling for a few moments, ask yourself:

> *"Who is observing the thinking? Who notices that thinking is happening?"*

Notice: There is an awareness **behind** the thoughts. That awareness is **you**—the Listener.

### 5. Return When Lost

You will get pulled back into thoughts (hijacked by the DMN). This is normal and expected.

When you realize you've been lost in thought, gently celebrate: "Awareness has returned!" and go back to observing.

## What You're Training

**Neurologically**: This practice activates the **Salience Network** (the neurological Listener) and begins to modulate DMN hyperactivity.

**Philosophically**: You're practicing the Gnostic *anamnesis* (recollection)—remembering your true identity as the Listener, not the voice.

## Common Experiences

### "The voice gets louder when I try to observe it!"

This is common. The DMN, sensing it's being observed, may intensify. This is actually progress—you're becoming aware of what was previously unconscious.

### "I can't stop thinking."

You're not trying to stop thinking. You're trying to **see** thinking as a process separate from you. Even noticing "I can't stop thinking" is awareness—you're the one noticing that thought.

### "Nothing happens."

The "happening" is subtle: it's the space, the gap, the awareness between you and the voice. Progress isn't dramatic; it's the gradual recognition of this space.

## Integration

Throughout your day, practice micro-versions:

- While waiting (in line, at a stoplight), notice: "What is the voice saying right now?"
- Label it: "Planning," "Judging," "Remembering"
- Ask: "Who is listening?"

## Next Steps

After practicing this daily for 1-2 weeks, add:

- [Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor) — Grounding in present-moment sensations
- [Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration) — Extending awareness throughout the day
