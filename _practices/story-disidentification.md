# Dis-Identifying from Story

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (formal practice) + ongoing awareness  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Goal**: Break the DMN's compulsive narrative loops by recognizing stories as constructions, not reality

## The Practice

The hijacked DMN doesn't just generate thoughts—it weaves them into **stories**. Stories about who you are, what happened, what it means, what will happen next. These narratives create the illusion of a continuous "self" moving through time.

This practice trains you to **see the story as a story**—not as truth.

## Formal Practice (Sitting)

### Setup

1. **Sit comfortably** with eyes closed or softly focused
2. **Set timer** for 15-20 minutes
3. **Intention**: "I am here to witness the storyteller"

### The Practice

1. **Settle into presence**
   - Begin with a few minutes of breath awareness
   - Ground in the body, the present moment

2. **Watch for narrative emergence**
   - Notice when the DMN begins constructing a story
   - Common triggers: planning, remembering, self-judgment, fantasy
   - Example narratives:
     - "I need to figure out what to say in that meeting..."
     - "I can't believe they said that to me yesterday..."
     - "If I just get X, then I'll finally be happy..."

3. **Label the story**
   - When you catch a narrative loop, mentally label it:
     - "Story about the future"
     - "Story about the past"
     - "Story about who I am"
     - "Story about what I need"
   - **Don't analyze or engage**—just label and return to presence

4. **Notice the gap**
   - Between labeling and the next thought, there's a gap
   - This gap is **story-free awareness**
   - Rest here, even if only for a moment

5. **Repeat**
   - Story arises → Label → Notice gap → Story arises...
   - This is the rhythm of the practice

### Close

- Take three breaths
- Notice: Are you still believing every story the Voice tells?

## Informal Practice (Daily Life)

The real work happens **throughout the day**:

### Morning

Upon waking, notice the **first story** the DMN generates:
- "Ugh, I don't want to get up..."
- "I have so much to do today..."
- Label it: "Story about resistance" or "Story about overwhelm"

### During Difficult Moments

When triggered (conflict, anxiety, frustration):

1. **Pause**
2. **Ask**: "What story is running right now?"
3. **Name it**:
   - "Story about being wronged"
   - "Story about not being good enough"
   - "Story about the future going wrong"
4. **Return to direct experience**: What is actually happening *right now*, without the story?

### Common Stories to Watch For

| **Story Type** | **Example** | **Reality** |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Identity story | "I'm such a failure" | Thought arising in awareness |
| Victim story | "They always do this to me" | Interpretation of events |
| Future story | "This will never work out" | Speculation about unknown |
| Past story | "If only I had done X..." | Rumination on unchangeable |
| Meaning story | "This means I'm unlovable" | DMN assigning significance |

## What You're Training

### Neurologically

- **Disrupting DMN dominance**: Each time you label a story, you activate the Salience Network (Listener), which anti-correlates with DMN
- **Weakening narrative self-reference**: The DMN's medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) generates self-referential narratives; dis-identification reduces its compulsive activation
- **Building meta-narrative awareness**: The ability to see that you are not the story

### Philosophically

- **Gnostic**: The counterfeit spirit operates through story—making you believe you *are* the character in the drama. Gnosis is recognizing you are the Divine Spark observing the play.
- **Buddhist**: Stories are *papañca* (conceptual proliferation)—the mind's compulsive elaboration. Dis-identification is the path to *nirodha* (cessation).
- **Indigenous**: Wetiko survives by keeping you identified with the narrative. Breaking the story breaks its hold.

## Common Experiences

### "I can't stop the stories—they just keep coming"

You're not trying to stop them. The DMN will generate stories as long as you're alive. The practice is to **stop believing them automatically**. Label and release, over and over.

### "But some stories are true!"

Stories can contain *information*, but they are not the same as direct experience. The story "I have a meeting tomorrow" contains useful data—but the anxiety-laden narrative about how it will go is pure DMN speculation. Learn to distinguish.

### "I feel lost without my stories"

This is the Ego sensing its foundation crumbling. The stories create the illusion of a stable "self." As you dis-identify, you may temporarily feel disoriented. This is normal. The Divine Spark doesn't need stories to exist—it is pure presence.

### "I'm now creating stories about not creating stories"

Welcome to the meta-loop! The DMN will even weaponize the practice. Just label this too: "Story about spiritual progress." Then return to presence. No story is sacred.

## Integration

### Weekly Review

Once a week, journal:
- What are the **top 3 recurring stories** my DMN tells?
- What function do they serve? (Protection, control, identity maintenance?)
- What would life be like if I stopped believing them?

### Story Inventory

Create a list of your core narratives:
- About yourself ("I'm not good enough")
- About others ("People can't be trusted")
- About life ("The world is dangerous")

Keep this list visible. When you catch these stories running, you'll recognize them faster.

## Next Steps

- Deepen with **[Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry)** to investigate the "I" at the center of all stories
- Combine with **[Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon)** to approach the storyteller with compassion
- Read about the neuroscience: **[DMN and the Narrative Self](/neuroscience/dmn-narrative-self)**
