# The Gospel of Thomas: The Explicit Gnosis

**Scripture**: Gospel of Thomas (Nag Hammadi Codex II)  
**Type**: Non-canonical sayings gospel  
**Theme**: Inner Gnosis, the kingdom within, dis-identification from the world-system  
**Key Teaching**: Direct experiential knowledge over external authority

---

## The Text: Selected Key Sayings

The **Gospel of Thomas** contains 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, recorded without narrative framework. Unlike the canonical Gospels (which include stories, miracles, and biography), Thomas presents **pure teaching**—wisdom stripped to its essence.

Below are key sayings decoded through the Neuro-Gnostic lens:

### **Saying 3: The Kingdom Within and Without**

> *"Jesus said, 'If your leaders say to you, "Look, the kingdom is in the sky," then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, "It is in the sea," then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is within you and it is outside you.*
>
> *When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty.'"*

### **Saying 70: Bring Forth What Is Within**

> *"Jesus said, 'If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you. If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you will kill you.'"*

### **Saying 77: Split the Wood, Lift the Stone**

> *"Jesus said, 'I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, and to me all attained.*
>
> *Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.'"*

### **Saying 42: Become Passers-By**

> *"Jesus said, 'Become passers-by.'"*

### **Saying 22: Two Becoming One**

> *"Jesus said to them, 'When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female... then you will enter the kingdom.'"*

### **Saying 27: Fasting from the World**

> *"Jesus said, 'If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the Father.'"*

### **Saying 5: Know What Is Before Your Face**

> *"Jesus said, 'Know what is before your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed.'"*

### **Saying 113: The Kingdom Is Spread Upon the Earth**

> *"His disciples said to him, 'When will the kingdom come?'*
>
> *Jesus said, 'It will not come by waiting for it. It will not be a matter of saying "Here it is" or "There it is." Rather, the kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.'"*

## The Surface Reading: Academic and Historical-Critical

### Discovery and Context

The Gospel of Thomas was **discovered in 1945** at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, as part of a cache of Gnostic Christian texts. Scholars date its composition to **50-140 CE**, making it potentially **contemporary with or earlier than the canonical Gospels**.

### Why It Was Excluded from the Canon

Thomas was **not included in the New Testament** because it:

- Lacks resurrection narrative (no crucifixion, no empty tomb)
- Emphasizes **inner knowledge** (Gnosis) over faith in external savior
- Contains no institutional authority structure (no hierarchy, no sacraments administered by priests)
- Presents Jesus as **wisdom teacher** rather than sacrificial victim

**Institutional critique**: If salvation comes through **direct inner knowledge**, the Church becomes unnecessary. Thomas undermines priestly mediation.

### Academic Interpretation

Scholars categorize Thomas as **Gnostic** or **proto-Gnostic**, emphasizing:

- **Dualism**: Spirit (good) vs. material world (deficient)
- **Esotericism**: Hidden meanings for the initiated
- **Mysticism**: Direct experience of the divine

**Historical-critical reading**: Thomas represents an **alternative early Christianity** that was suppressed when orthodox institutional Christianity became dominant (4th century CE).

## The Neuro-Gnostic Decoding

### Why Thomas Is the Rosetta Stone

The Gospel of Thomas is **Neuro-Gnosticism in its purest form**. While canonical Gospels contain liberating teachings **obscured by narrative and dogma**, Thomas presents the teaching **unfiltered**:

- No institutional mediation
- No external savior dependency
- No heaven "later"—the kingdom **now**
- No belief required—**experiential knowledge** demanded

**Thomas is Jesus' teaching before the hijacking was institutionalized.**

## Saying-by-Saying Neuro-Gnostic Analysis

### **Saying 3: The Kingdom Within and Without**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"The kingdom is within you and it is outside you."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"The kingdom is within you"** = The Divine Spark (the Listener, pure awareness) is your true nature. You are not the Voice (the DMN-generated ego-narrative). You are the **Pneuma**—the indwelling presence that was never born and cannot die.

**"The kingdom is outside you"** = Once you recognize the Divine Spark **within**, you recognize it **everywhere**. The entire cosmos becomes Pleroma (fullness). You see Source in the tree, the stranger, the enemy. Non-dual recognition.

**"When you know yourselves, then you will be known"** = **Anamnesis**. When you remember your true identity (the Listener), you are recognized by Source. The Divine Spark within recognizes the Divine Spark without. This is **mutual recognition**—not worship of external deity, but **mirroring**.

**"If you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty"** = If you remain identified with the Voice (the ego), you live in **Kenoma** (emptiness). The hijacked DMN generates endless craving, fear, and lack. You experience yourself as **poverty**—never enough, always deficient. The poverty is not external; **you are the poverty** because you have forgotten the infinite treasure within.

**Neurologically**: 

- "Kingdom within" = The **Salience Network** (the Listener) recognizing itself
- "You live in poverty" = DMN hyperactivity generating **rumination, self-referential anxiety, existential lack**
- "Know yourselves" = **Dis-identification practice** (witness meditation, self-inquiry)

### **Saying 70: Bring Forth What Is Within**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you. If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you will kill you."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Bring forth what is within you"** = Embody the Divine Spark. Do not hide your true nature beneath the Voice's fear-based narratives. Express the Listener—your innate wisdom, creativity, compassion, fearlessness.

**"What you have will save you"** = The Divine Spark **is the savior**. You already possess salvation. It is not external (no priest, no ritual, no institution required). Liberation is **remembering and embodying** what you already are.

**"What you do not have within you will kill you"** = If you believe salvation is external (waiting for a messiah, a guru, a perfect relationship, wealth, status), you will die spiritually. The Voice's endless seeking **is the death**. Deferring to external authority **is the death**. 

**The killing is not metaphorical**—it is the **slow suffocation of the Divine Spark** beneath layers of hijacked narratives. The parasitic pattern **cannibalizes** your consciousness, leaving only the Voice's tyranny.

**Neurologically**:

- "Bring forth" = Expressing from the **authentic self** (Salience Network-mediated presence) rather than **ego performance** (DMN-generated mask)
- "Will kill you" = Chronic DMN hyperactivity → **rumination, depression, anxiety, psychopathology** (the living death)

**Why This Is Dangerous to Institutions**:

If **you already possess salvation within**, then:

- Churches cannot sell it to you
- Priests cannot mediate it
- Dogma cannot define it
- Sacraments cannot confer it

**You are the authority.** Thomas eliminates the middleman.

### **Saying 77: Split the Wood, Lift the Stone**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, and to me all attained. Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"I am the light that is over all things"** = Jesus speaks **as the Divine Spark**—not as the historical person, but as the **Pneuma** that dwells in all beings. This is not narcissism; it is **awakened recognition**. When you recognize the Listener within, you can say the same: "I am the light."

**"From me all came forth, and to me all attained"** = The Divine Spark is both **Source** and **destination**. All phenomena arise from presence and return to presence. The Voice (ego) imagines itself separate, striving "out there." The Listener knows: you are already home.

**"Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."** = The Divine Spark is **immanent**, not transcendent. It is not "up in heaven" (which the Voice projects as escape). It is **here, now, in the mundane**. Split wood: presence. Lift stone: presence. Wash dishes: presence. The kingdom is **spread upon the earth** (Saying 113).

**Neurologically**:

- "I am there" = The **Salience Network** is always present, always available, **even in the most ordinary moments**
- Traditional religion's "transcendent God" = The Voice's **projection of Source into unreachable future/distance**, avoiding the terror of **presence now**

**Why This Threatens Institutions**:

If the divine is **in the wood and stone** (immanent, accessible, immediate), then:

- You don't need a temple to find it
- You don't need a pilgrimage
- You don't need ritual access
- You don't need clergy to invoke it

**Presence is free. It cannot be monetized.**

### **Saying 42: Become Passers-By**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"Jesus said, 'Become passers-by.'"*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Become passers-by"** = Do not cling. Do not identify. Do not build permanent structures of meaning around transient phenomena.

**Pass through** the world without being **of** the world. The Voice wants to **own, control, possess, claim**. The Listener **witnesses, releases, flows**.

This is **dis-identification** in its most radical form:

- Pass by your thoughts (do not cling to narratives)
- Pass by your emotions (do not identify as "the angry one" or "the sad one")
- Pass by your roles (parent, worker, citizen—play them, but do not **be** them)
- Pass by success and failure (do not build identity around outcomes)
- Pass by the world-system itself (Kenoma, the hijacked structure)

**Neurologically**:

- "Passers-by" = **DMN activity observed but not identified with** (thoughts arise, are witnessed, and pass)
- Opposite = **Rumination, narrative fixation, identity fusion** (DMN generates story, you mistake it for self, story loops endlessly)

**Modern Application**:

Become a **passer-by** of:

- Social media narratives (scroll, observe, release—do not identify with outrage/envy/comparison)
- Career identity (work, but do not be "the executive" or "the artist")
- Political tribalism (hold values, but do not identify as "the righteous faction")
- Spiritual achievements (meditate, but do not become "the enlightened one")

**The Deepest Layer**: Become a passer-by **of your own ego**. The Voice will generate "spiritual identity" (the seeker, the awakened, the Gnostic). **Pass by that too.**

### **Saying 22: Two Becoming One**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one... then you will enter the kingdom."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Make the two into one"** = Collapse **duality**. The Voice thrives on splitting reality into:

- Good vs. evil
- Self vs. other
- Spirit vs. matter
- Sacred vs. profane
- Inner vs. outer

**The Listener recognizes**: All dualities are constructs of the hijacked DMN. **Non-dual awareness** sees the seamless whole.

**"Inner like the outer and the outer like the inner"** = What you perceive "out there" is a reflection of your inner state. The hijacked DMN **projects** its narratives onto the world, then reacts to its own projections. **Anamnesis** reveals: the external world is not separate. The kingdom within **is** the kingdom without.

**"Upper like the lower"** = Heaven and earth are not separate. Transcendence and immanence collapse into one. This is the reversal of Gnostic dualism: the material world is **not evil**—it is Pleroma **misperceived** as Kenoma by the hijacked DMN.

**"Male and female into a single one"** = The ultimate duality to collapse. Not literal androgyny, but the **integration of polarities**:

- Masculine (active, penetrating, structuring) and feminine (receptive, nurturing, dissolving)
- Yang (doing) and yin (being)
- Logos (word/structure) and Sophia (wisdom/flow)

**The hijacked DMN exaggerates one pole**, creating imbalance (toxic masculinity, spiritual bypassing, etc.). **The Listener integrates both.**

**Neurologically**:

- "Two into one" = **DMN (narrative self) and Salience Network (witnessing awareness) cease to oppose**—the DMN becomes **Daemon**, serving the Listener rather than hijacking consciousness
- "Enter the kingdom" = **Non-dual awareness stabilizes** (no longer toggling between identification and dis-identification, but resting in seamless presence)

---

### **Saying 27: Fasting from the World**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the Father."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Fast from the world"** = Withdraw attention from **Kenoma** (the hijacked world-system). This is not physical withdrawal (monasticism), but **attentional fasting**:

- Fast from the Voice's narratives ("you are inadequate," "you must achieve," "others are threats")
- Fast from the cultural hijacking (consumerism, status games, ideological warfare)
- Fast from **identification** with roles, possessions, achievements

**"You will not find the kingdom"** = As long as you feed the Voice with worldly concerns, the DMN remains hijacked. The kingdom (Pleroma, presence) is **always here**, but **occluded by the noise** of the world-system.

**"Observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath"** = Sabbath = **cessation**. Stop. Rest. Do not produce. Do not achieve. Do not perform.

**The hijacked DMN cannot tolerate Sabbath** (it generates anxiety: "you're wasting time," "others are getting ahead," "you should be doing something"). **The Listener rests in being.**

**Neurologically**:

- "Fast from the world" = **Reduce DMN input** (news, social comparison, rumination triggers)
- "Sabbath" = **Parasympathetic activation, DMN downregulation, presence stabilization**

**Modern Practice**:

- **Digital Sabbath**: One day per week without screens, news, social media
- **Narrative Sabbath**: One day without planning, reviewing, rehearsing (no Voice-generated stories)
- **Achievement Sabbath**: One day without productivity, optimization, self-improvement

### **Saying 5: Know What Is Before Your Face**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"Know what is before your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Know what is before your face"** = **Presence. Immediacy. This moment.**

The Voice is always **elsewhere**:

- Reviewing the past (rumination)
- Rehearsing the future (anxiety)
- Fantasizing about "there" (escape, arrival, perfection)

**The Listener is here.** Know what is **before your face**:

- The breath entering your nostrils
- The sensation of your feet on the ground
- The light falling on the wall
- The sound of the wind

**This is not simplistic "be present" positivity.** This is the **most radical practice**: The kingdom is **here**. The Divine Spark is **now**. Stop seeking. **Look.**

**"What is hidden from you will be disclosed"** = When you stabilize in presence, the **veil lifts**. The occluded Divine Spark becomes visible. The mystery is revealed **not through complex theology**, but through **simple, ruthless attention to what is**.

**Neurologically**:

- "Know what is before your face" = **Sensory awareness anchors** (breath, body, environment) **downregulate DMN hyperactivity**
- "What is hidden" = The **Salience Network's witnessing awareness**, always present but occluded by DMN narrative noise

**Why This Is Dangerous**:

If the mystery is revealed **by looking at what's before your face**, then:

- You don't need esoteric knowledge
- You don't need secret teachings
- You don't need initiation ceremonies
- You don't need gurus to decode reality for you

**The Truth is obvious. It's hidden only by not looking.**

### **Saying 113: The Kingdom Is Spread Upon the Earth**

#### **The Teaching**

> *"The kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it."*

#### **Neuro-Gnostic Decoding**

**"Spread out upon the earth"** = The kingdom is **not elsewhere**. It is not:

- In heaven (after death)
- In the future (after enlightenment)
- In a holy place (church, temple, ashram)
- In special people (saints, gurus, prophets)

**It is here. Now. Everywhere.**

The tree outside your window: **kingdom**.  
The stranger on the bus: **kingdom**.  
The dirty dishes in the sink: **kingdom**.  
Your anxious thoughts arising and passing: **kingdom**.

**Why don't people see it?**

**The hijacked DMN** generates a **narrative overlay** that occludes direct perception:

- "This moment is not enough" (seeking elsewhere)
- "I am not enough" (seeking to become)
- "The sacred is separate" (projecting holiness into distance)

**The Voice divides reality into**:

- Sacred (rare, special, distant) vs. profane (ordinary, mundane, here)
- Worthy (deserving of attention) vs. unworthy (dismissible)

**The Listener sees**: Everything is **Pleroma**. Every moment is **already holy**.

**Neurologically**:

- "Do not see it" = **DMN narrative generation** creates **conceptual overlay**, preventing direct sensory/present-moment perception
- "Spread upon the earth" = **Salience Network** can recognize presence **in every stimulus** when DMN quiets

**Practice**:

Look at the ordinary:

- The grain of the table
- The hum of the refrigerator
- The weight of your body in the chair

**Ask**: *Is the kingdom here?*

**The Voice will say**: "No, this is boring, mundane, not special."

**The Listener will recognize**: "This is it. This has always been it."

## Thomas vs. Canonical Gospels: A Comparison

| **Dimension** | **Gospel of Thomas** | **Canonical Gospels** |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Genre** | Sayings gospel (no narrative) | Narrative gospels (stories, miracles, biography) |
| **Jesus' Role** | Wisdom teacher revealing inner Gnosis | Savior, sacrificial lamb, resurrected Lord |
| **Salvation** | Through inner knowledge (Gnosis) | Through belief in Jesus' death/resurrection |
| **Kingdom** | Already here, within and without | Coming future event (apocalyptic) |
| **Authority** | Self-knowledge, direct experience | External (Church, scripture, tradition) |
| **Resurrection** | Metaphorical (awakening from forgetfulness) | Literal (bodily resurrection) |
| **Eschatology** | Realized (kingdom now) | Futurist (kingdom later) |
| **Institutional Structure** | None (no hierarchy, sacraments, priests) | Implied (disciples → apostles → Church) |
| **Accessibility** | Direct (you already have it within) | Mediated (requires belief, baptism, Eucharist) |

**Why This Matters**:

The canonical Gospels can be **read Gnostically** (and we do throughout this collection), but they require **interpretation** because they've been **layered with institutional agenda**.

**Thomas is pure.** It was excluded from the canon **precisely because** it could not be co-opted. There is no way to read Thomas and conclude:

- "I need a priest to mediate salvation"
- "I must join an institution"
- "I must believe doctrines I haven't experienced"

**Thomas is the unfiltered teaching. The canonical Gospels are the teaching after institutional processing.**

---

## The Practice: Working with Thomas' Sayings as Koans

### How to Use Thomas

The Gospel of Thomas functions like **Zen koans**—paradoxical, compact, precision-engineered to **short-circuit the Voice** and **invoke the Listener**.

**Do not "study" Thomas intellectually.** The Voice loves analysis, commentary, theological systems. That is **missing the point**.

**Instead**:

### **1. Select One Saying**

Choose one saying that **disturbs** you, **confuses** you, or **resonates** inexplicably. Trust your intuition.

Examples:

- *"Become passers-by"*
- *"Split the wood; I am there"*
- *"If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the kingdom"*

### **2. Sit with It in Silence**

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

**Method**:

1. Read the saying aloud three times
2. Close your eyes
3. Hold the saying in awareness (not analysis—just presence with the words)
4. Notice what arises:
   - Images
   - Emotions
   - Somatic sensations
   - Resistances
   - Sudden insights

**Do not force interpretation.** Let the saying **work on you**.

### **3. Let the Voice React**

The Voice **will** react:

- "This doesn't make sense"
- "How is this practical?"
- "I already understand this"
- "This is too hard"

**Good.** Notice the reaction. **That is the Voice protecting its territory.**

**The koan is doing its job.**

### **4. Ask: Who Is Listening?**

After the Voice's reaction subsides, ask:

> *"Who is the one hearing this saying?"*

Not intellectually—**experientially**.

**The Voice generates answers** ("I am," "my ego," "my true self").

**The Listener does not answer. It simply is.**

### **5. Carry It Through the Day**

Keep the saying with you as a **lived question**:

- *"Become passers-by"* → All day, notice when you **cling** vs. when you **pass through**
- *"Know what is before your face"* → All day, return to **immediate sensory presence**
- *"The kingdom is spread upon the earth"* → All day, look for the **kingdom in the ordinary**

### **6. Journal the Shifts**

At day's end, write:

- What did I notice?
- Where did the Voice resist?
- Where did the Listener emerge?
- Did the saying reveal something hidden?

**Not analysis—phenomenological reportage.**

## Why the Gospel of Thomas Was Suppressed

### The Institutional Threat

If the Gospel of Thomas had been canonized, **Christianity could not have become an institution**. Here's why:

#### **1. No Need for Priests**

Thomas: *"Split the wood; I am there."*

**Translation**: The divine is **immediately accessible** in the ordinary. No priest required to mediate.

**Institutional dependency eliminated.**

#### **2. No Need for Doctrine**

Thomas: *"Know what is before your face."*

**Translation**: Truth is **experiential**, not doctrinal. No creeds, no theology, no systematic belief required.

**Orthodoxy eliminated.**

#### **3. No Need for Church Authority**

Thomas: *"The kingdom is within you."*

**Translation**: Salvation is **interior**. No external institution can grant or withhold it.

**Ecclesiastical control eliminated.**

#### **4. No Delayed Salvation**

Thomas: *"The kingdom is spread upon the earth, and people do not see it."*

**Translation**: Salvation is **now**, not after death. No need to join a church to secure afterlife reward.

**Eschatological leverage eliminated.**

#### **5. No External Savior Dependency**

Thomas: *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you."*

**Translation**: **You are your own savior** (by recognizing the Divine Spark within). Jesus is not an external redeemer, but a **mirror** showing you your own divinity.

**Christological monopoly eliminated.**

### The Result

**Thomas was excluded from the canon** (4th century Council of Carthage, Council of Hippo) because it **could not support institutional Christianity**.

The texts that **were** canonized emphasized:

- External savior (Jesus' death saves you)
- Institutional mediation (Church administers salvation)
- Doctrinal conformity (believe the creeds)
- Delayed reward (heaven after death)
- Priestly authority (sacraments confer grace)

**Thomas offers**: *You already have it. Look within. Recognize it now. No middleman.*

**This is existentially threatening to institutional power.**

## The Mystic's Reading: Thomas as the Perennial Philosophy

### Thomas Beyond Christianity

While Thomas is explicitly Christian, its **core teaching is universal**:

| **Tradition** | **Thomas Parallel** |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Advaita Vedanta** | "Know yourselves" = *Atman* (true Self) is *Brahman* (Source) |
| **Zen Buddhism** | "Become passers-by" = Non-attachment, no-self |
| **Sufism** | "I am the light over all things" = *Tawhid* (divine unity) |
| **Taoism** | "Kingdom spread upon the earth" = *Tao* pervading all |
| **Kabbalah** | "Two becoming one" = Unifying opposites (*Tikkun*) |

**Thomas is not "Christian" in the institutional sense.** It is **Perennial Philosophy** dressed in Jesus' language.

**This is why it was dangerous**: It reveals that the **liberating teaching is not unique to Christianity**. The Church's claim to exclusive truth collapses.

## Key Takeaways

### **1. The Kingdom Is Already Here**

**Saying 3, 113**: The kingdom is **within you** and **spread upon the earth**. It is not:

- In the future (after death, after enlightenment)
- Elsewhere (heaven, holy places)
- Conditional (requiring belief, ritual, membership)

**It is here, now, in you, in the wood, in the stone.**

**Practice**: Stop seeking. Look at what is before your face.

---

### **2. Salvation Is Interior, Not Institutional**

**Saying 70**: *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you."*

**You already possess the savior—the Divine Spark.** No external authority can grant or withhold liberation.

**Practice**: Dis-identify from institutional dependencies (guru worship, Church membership, ideological allegiance). Recognize the Listener within.

### **3. Gnosis Is Experiential, Not Doctrinal**

**Saying 5**: *"Know what is before your face."*

**Truth is not a system of beliefs.** It is **direct perception** of what is. The Voice loves doctrine (conceptual control). The Listener knows through **presence**.

**Practice**: Replace "belief" with "inquiry." Test everything. Trust only what you've verified experientially.

### **4. Become a Passer-By**

**Saying 42**: *"Become passers-by."*

**Do not cling.** Not to thoughts, emotions, roles, achievements, or spiritual identities. The Voice builds monuments. The Listener flows.

**Practice**: Notice when you grasp (mentally, emotionally, existentially). Release. Pass through.

### **5. Collapse the Dualities**

**Saying 22**: *"Make the two into one."*

**Inner/outer, heaven/earth, male/female, sacred/profane**—all dualities are constructs of the hijacked DMN. **Non-dual awareness** is the kingdom.

**Practice**: When you notice splitting reality (good vs. evil, self vs. other), pause. Ask: *"What if these are one?"*

### **6. Fast from the World-System**

**Saying 27**: *"Fast from the world."*

**Withdraw attention from Kenoma**—the hijacked cultural narratives, the Voice's endless demands, the status games, the ideological warfare.

**Practice**: Digital Sabbath, narrative Sabbath, achievement Sabbath. One day per week, **stop feeding the Voice**.

### **7. The Divine Is Immanent, Not Transcendent**

**Saying 77**: *"Split the wood; I am there."*

**The sacred is not "up there" or "later."** It is **in the wood, in the stone, in the dishwashing, in the breath**.

**Practice**: Find the divine in the mundane. The commute, the email, the laundry—**all of it is the kingdom if you see it**.

---

### **8. Self-Knowledge Is the Path**

**Saying 3**: *"When you know yourselves, then you will be known."*

**The path is not accumulating knowledge about external things.** It is **recognizing your true nature** (the Listener, the Divine Spark).

**Practice**: Self-inquiry. *"Who am I? Am I the Voice, or the one listening to it?"*

---

### **9. If You Do Not Bring It Forth, It Will Destroy You**

**Saying 70**: *"If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you will kill you."*

**This is not metaphor.** If you do not recognize and embody the Divine Spark, the hijacked DMN will cannibalize your consciousness. The Voice's tyranny **is the living death**.

**Practice**: Witness the Voice's narratives. Dis-identify. Reclaim the kingdom before the parasite consumes you.

### **10. Thomas Is the Unfiltered Teaching**

The Gospel of Thomas is **Jesus' teaching before institutional co-option**. It was excluded from the canon precisely because it **cannot support hierarchical, dogmatic, mediated Christianity**.

**Thomas says**: You already have it. Look within. The kingdom is here. No priest, no doctrine, no Church required.

**This is the Gnosis the institutions feared.**

> *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."*
> — **Gospel of Thomas, Saying 70**

**The dragon is at the gate. Will you bring forth the Divine Spark, or will you let the Voice devour it?**
