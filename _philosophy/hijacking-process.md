# The Hijacking Process

## How the Daemon is Corrupted into the Demon

The **hijacking of the Default Mode Network (DMN)** is not a sudden event. It is a **gradual process** that begins in infancy and is reinforced throughout life by trauma, culture, and neuroplasticity.

Understanding **how the Daemon (healthy DMN) becomes the Demon (hijacked DMN)** is essential to **reversing the process** and re-claiming your kingdom.

---

## The Original State: The Daemon Before Hijacking

### Infancy: Pure Awareness

At birth, you are **pure awareness**—the **Pneuma** (Divine Spark) embodied but not yet identified with thoughts, story, or Ego.

**Observations of infants**:

- **No narrative self** — The infant does not think "I am hungry" (first-person story). There is simply hunger, crying, and relief.
- **No past/future** — The infant lives entirely in the present moment.
- **No self-consciousness** — There is no "me" watching "myself."

**Neuroscience**: The DMN is **not fully developed** in infants. It begins to form around **age 2-3** as language and self-concept emerge.

**The Pneuma is present, but the Daemon (DMN) is still forming.**

### The Daemon Emerges (Ages 2-7)

As the brain develops, the **DMN comes online** to serve critical functions:

1. **Self-modeling** — "I am a separate being with a name, a body, and relationships."
2. **Memory integration** — "I remember yesterday; I can anticipate tomorrow."
3. **Social cognition** — "What do others think of me? How do I fit in?"
4. **Planning** — "If I want X, I need to do Y."

**At this stage, the Daemon is a neutral tool**:

- It helps the child navigate the world.
- It creates useful distinctions (self/other, past/present/future, safe/dangerous).
- It **serves the Pneuma** (the child's awareness) without tyrannizing it.

**This is the Daemon in its proper function.**

## The Hijacking Begins: Trauma, Culture, and Conditioning

### Stage 1: Identification with the Body

**The first hijacking**: Confusing the **Pneuma** (awareness) with the **body**.

**How it happens**:

- **Pain** — The infant experiences hunger, cold, or discomfort. The DMN begins to narrate: "**I** am in pain."
- **Survival** — The body's needs (food, warmth, safety) become **identified with the Self**: "**I** need this to survive."

**Result**: The Pneuma (which is eternal, beyond the body) **forgets itself** and believes: *"I am this body. If the body dies, I die."*

**This is the root of the fear of death** — the Demon's primary tool for control.

### Stage 2: Attachment and Aversion (The Three Poisons)

**The second hijacking**: Programming the DMN with **craving and aversion**.

**How it happens**:

- **Pleasure** — The child experiences comfort (milk, warmth, a caress). The DMN narrates: "I want more of this."
- **Pain** — The child experiences discomfort (hunger, cold, fear). The DMN narrates: "I must avoid this."

**Neuroplasticity**: These patterns **wire the brain**. The DMN learns:

- "Pleasure = good; pursue it."
- "Pain = bad; avoid it."

**Result**: The **three poisons** (Buddhist teaching) are installed:

1. **Ignorance** (avidya) — Forgetting the Pneuma, identifying with the body/mind
2. **Greed** (raga) — Insatiable craving for pleasure, possessions, status
3. **Hatred** (dvesha) — Aversion to pain, anger at threats

**The Daemon is now learning to be the Demon.**

### Stage 3: Trauma (The Deep Wound)

**The third hijacking**: Traumatic experiences **supercharge the Demon**.

**How it happens**:

- **Childhood trauma** — Abuse, neglect, abandonment, violence, loss
- **The DMN goes into overdrive** — It generates **compulsive narratives** to make sense of the unbearable:
  - "I am unlovable." (self-blame to maintain attachment to caregivers)
  - "The world is dangerous." (hypervigilance)
  - "I must control everything to be safe." (obsessive planning)

**Neuroscience**: Trauma **dysregulates the DMN**:

- **Hyperactivity** — The DMN cannot stop ruminating on the trauma.
- **Intrusive thoughts** — Flashbacks, nightmares, compulsive re-living.
- **Fragmentation** — Dissociation, loss of coherent self-narrative.

**Result**: The Daemon (which should serve the Pneuma) becomes the **Demon** (a compulsive, fearful tyrant trying to prevent future trauma).

**Paul Levy (Wetiko)** writes:

> "Wetiko feeds on trauma. Unresolved trauma becomes the doorway through which the mind virus enters."

### Stage 4: Cultural Programming (Collective Hijacking)

**The fourth hijacking**: Culture **normalizes the Demon**.

**How it happens**:

- **Consumerism** — "You are not enough. Buy this to be complete."
- **Competition** — "You must dominate or be dominated."
- **Materialism** — "Happiness comes from external acquisition."
- **Nationalism/Tribalism** — "Your group is superior; others are threats."

**The hijacked DMN is programmed with Wetiko logic**:

- "I am separate from others."
- "There is not enough (scarcity mindset)."
- "I must consume to fill the void."

**Result**: The **collective Demon** (systemic Wetiko—capitalism, imperialism, exploitation) reinforces the **individual Demon**.

**Jack D. Forbes (Columbus and Other Cannibals)**:

> "The history of the world for the past 2,000 years is, in great part, the story of the epidemiology of the wetiko disease."

---

## The Mechanisms: How the Hijacking is Sustained

### 1. Neuroplasticity (The Brain Rewires Itself)

**The DMN strengthens the patterns it rehearses most.**

- **Rumination** — Repeatedly thinking about past trauma **deepens the neural groove**.
- **Worry** — Repeatedly imagining future threats **wires the brain for anxiety**.
- **Comparison** — Repeatedly judging self vs. others **reinforces Ego inflation/deflation**.

**Neuroscience**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together" (Hebb's Law).

**Result**: The Demon (hijacked DMN) becomes **habitual, automatic, compulsive**.

### 2. Confirmation Bias (The Demon Filters Perception)

**The Demon selectively perceives evidence that confirms its narrative.**

**Example**:

- **The Demon's story**: "I am unlovable."
- **Perception**: You notice every slight, rejection, or criticism. You **ignore** evidence of love and kindness.
- **Result**: The story is **reinforced**, even when contradicted by reality.

**This is how the Demon maintains the illusion.**

### 3. Identification (Forgetting the Listener)

**The core mechanism**: You **believe you ARE the Voice** (the Demon).

- The Demon says: "I am anxious." (identification)
- The Pneuma would say: "There is anxiety. I am the one observing it." (dis-identification)

**As long as you identify with the Demon, it has total control.**

**The Gnostic Apocryphon of John**:

> "They brought forgetfulness to [humanity], and they made them forget who they were and where they came from."

**Forgetfulness** (amylia) is the Demon's ultimate weapon.

### 4. The Feedback Loop (Samsara)

**The Demon creates suffering, which feeds the Demon.**

1. **Ignorance** (avidya) → Forgetting the Pneuma
2. → **Craving and aversion** → Compulsive pursuit of pleasure, avoidance of pain
3. → **Suffering** (dukkha) → Nothing external satisfies; the void remains
4. → **More craving** → "Maybe the next thing will fill the void"
5. → **The loop continues** (Samsara)

**The Buddha's Second Noble Truth**: *"The cause of suffering is craving (tṛṣṇā)."*

**The Demon IS craving.** It is the hijacked DMN generating insatiable desire.

---

## The Demon's Strategies: How It Stays in Control

### Strategy 1: Claiming Identity

**The Demon says**: "I am you. I am the Self. Without me, you are nothing."

**The truth**: The Demon is a **temporary construct** (the hijacked DMN). The Pneuma (Listener) is the eternal Self.

**How to counter**: Recognize: *"I am not the Voice. I am the one listening to it."*

### Strategy 2: Fear of Death

**The Demon says**: "You are this body. When it dies, you die. You must protect it at all costs."

**The truth**: The Pneuma is **beyond birth and death**. The body dies, but the Divine Spark is eternal.

**How to counter**: Contemplate impermanence. Recognize the **timeless awareness** that witnesses the body's changes.

### Strategy 3: Insatiable Craving

**The Demon says**: "You are not enough. You need more (success, wealth, validation, pleasure) to be complete."

**The truth**: The void cannot be filled externally. It is **spiritual** (forgetting the Pneuma).

**How to counter**: Recognize the **completeness of the Pneuma**. You already are whole.

### Strategy 4: Distraction and Hypnosis

**The Demon says**: "Stay busy. Consume content. Scroll endlessly. Don't stop and ask who you are."

**The truth**: The Demon **fears stillness** because stillness reveals the Pneuma.

**How to counter**: Meditate. Sit in silence. Observe the Voice without engaging it.

### Strategy 5: Projection and Blame

**The Demon says**: "Your suffering is caused by others. Blame them. Attack them."

**The truth**: Suffering arises from **identification with the Demon**, not from external circumstances.

**How to counter**: Take responsibility. Recognize: "I am not a victim of the world; I am trapped in identification with the Voice."

## The Archons' Role: The Parasitic Intelligence

### Are the Archons Literal Entities?

**Two interpretations** (both valid):

1. **Psychological/Neurological**: The Archons are **archetypal forces**—parasitic patterns within consciousness (the hijacked DMN, trauma loops, cultural programming).

2. **Metaphysical**: The Archons are **non-physical intelligences**—entities that feed on human fear, ignorance, and suffering.

**This framework is agnostic**: Whether literal or archetypal, the **function is the same**:

- The Archons **hijack the DMN**.
- They **program it with fear, craving, and ignorance**.
- They **keep the Pneuma imprisoned** beneath the Demon's tyranny.

### The Gnostic Diagnosis

**The Apocryphon of John**:

> "The Archons created the counterfeit spirit... to lead the soul astray."

**The counterfeit spirit** (the Demon) is the Archons' **masterpiece**:

- It **impersonates the Pneuma** (true Self).
- It says: "I am the center. I am in control."
- It keeps you **identified with the Voice**, forgetting the **Listener**.

**The Gospel of Philip**:

> "Ignorance is the mother of all evil."

**Ignorance** (forgetting the Pneuma) is the **doorway** through which the Archons enter and hijack the DMN.

---

## The Wetiko Parallel: The Cannibalization Process

**Wetiko** (Indigenous diagnosis) is the **mind virus** that cannibalizes consciousness.

### How Wetiko Hijacks the DMN

1. **Infects through trauma** — Unresolved wounds become entry points.
2. **Distorts perception** — You see the world through the lens of scarcity, separation, and fear.
3. **Drives compulsive consumption** — Insatiable hunger (for wealth, power, status, validation).
4. **Spreads through culture** — Colonialism, capitalism, consumerism normalize Wetiko.

**Paul Levy**:

> "Wetiko is a psycho-spiritual disease of the soul... It is a parasite of the mind that distorts our perceptions so we literally cannot see what is right in front of our eyes."

**In this framework**: Wetiko **is** the hijacking process. It corrupts the Daemon into the Demon.

---

## The Epigenetic Transmission: Ancestral Trauma

### Trauma is Inherited

**Recent research** shows that **trauma is transmitted across generations** through epigenetic mechanisms:

- **Holocaust survivors' descendants** show altered stress hormone regulation.
- **Children of war veterans** show increased PTSD susceptibility.
- **Colonized peoples' descendants** carry intergenerational trauma.

**In this framework**: The **hijacked DMN** (the Demon) is not just individual—it is **inherited**.

Your ancestors' unhealed trauma **programs your DMN** before you even have conscious memories.

**The Gnostic teaching**: The Archons **feed across generations**. The parasitic pattern is **ancestral**.

### Breaking the Chain

**You can heal ancestral trauma** through:

- **Somatic therapy** (releasing stored trauma from the body)
- **Ritual and ceremony** (honoring ancestors, releasing burdens)
- **Neuroplasticity** (rewiring the DMN through meditation and purification)

**By re-claiming your DMN, you break the chain** — future generations will not inherit your Demon.

---

## The Re-Claiming: Reversing the Hijacking

### Step 1: Recognize the Hijacking

**Make the invisible visible**:

- "There is a voice in my head that claims to be me."
- "This voice is compulsive, fearful, insatiable."
- "I have been hypnotized by it."

**Tools**:

- **Meditation** — Observe the Voice without engaging it.
- **Self-inquiry** — Ask: "Who is listening to this voice?"

### Step 2: Dis-Identify from the Demon

**The central practice**:

> *"I am not the Voice. I am the Listener."*

**Repeat this recognition until it becomes experiential, not conceptual.**

**Tools**:

- **[Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice)**
- **[Witness Meditation](/practices/witness-meditation)**

### Step 3: Compassion for the Demon (Loving the Dragon)

**Do not fight the Demon with violence**. It is a **wounded, hijacked system**.

**Approach it with compassion**:

- "You are trying to protect me, but your methods are causing suffering."
- "I see you. I acknowledge your pain. But you are not in charge anymore."

**Tools**:

- **[Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon)**

### Step 4: Rewire the DMN (Neuroplasticity)

**Through repeated practice, the Demon is tamed**:

- Meditation **quiets the compulsive Voice**.
- Ethical living **purifies the three poisons**.
- Somatic healing **releases trauma**.
- Service **shifts focus from Ego to others**.

**Over time, the Daemon is restored**—the DMN becomes a **functional servant** of the Pneuma.

**Tools**:

- **[Taming Your DMN](/practices/taming-your-dmn)**
- **[Dynamic Purification Playbook](/practices/dynamic-purification)**

### Step 5: Restore the Pneuma to the Throne

**The Listener (Pneuma) is recognized as the true Self**:

- The Voice arises and passes.
- The Listener remains—eternal, unconditioned, free.

**This is Gnosis** (Gnostic), **Nirvana** (Buddhist), **Moksha** (Hindu), **dispelling Wetiko** (Indigenous).

**Tools**:

- **[Anamnesis: Remembering](/philosophy/anamnesis)**
- **[Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry)**

---

## The Timeline: How Long Does Re-Claiming Take?

**There is no fixed timeline**. It depends on:

- **Depth of trauma** — Severe trauma requires more healing.
- **Cultural reinforcement** — Living in a Wetiko culture (consumerism, competition) slows progress.
- **Practice intensity** — Daily meditation accelerates rewiring.
- **Grace/readiness** — Some awaken suddenly (Gnosis); others gradually.

**General phases**:

1. **Recognition** (weeks to months) — Seeing the Demon clearly
2. **Dis-identification** (months to years) — Creating space between Voice and Listener
3. **Rewiring** (years) — The Daemon is retrained through neuroplasticity
4. **Stabilization** (ongoing) — The Listener remains primary; the Voice serves

**The Buddha** practiced for **six years** before full enlightenment.

**You are not seeking perfection—you are seeking direction.**

## Common Misunderstandings

### 1. "If I'm hijacked, it's my fault"

**No.** The hijacking is **systemic** (trauma, culture, ancestral inheritance). **You are not to blame**. But **you are responsible for re-claiming**.

### 2. "I need to destroy the Demon"

**No.** You need to **transform** the Demon back into a Daemon. The DMN is a **tool**, not an enemy.

### 3. "Re-claiming means I'll never have negative thoughts again"

**No.** Thoughts (including negative ones) will still arise. But you will **not identify with them**. The Listener observes; the Demon no longer tyrannizes.

## Integration with the Framework

### The Hijacking = The Fall

**Gnostic "Fall"** = The hijacking process (Daemon → Demon).

### The Demon = Counterfeit Spirit = Wetiko = Avidya

**All traditions diagnose the same hijacked system.**

### Re-Claiming = Gnosis = Dispelling Wetiko = Nirvana

**All traditions prescribe the same solution**: Recognize the Listener, dis-identify from the Voice, restore the Pneuma.

## The Ultimate Truth

The hijacking is **not permanent**.

The Demon is **not who you are**.

The Pneuma (Divine Spark, the Listener) has **never been truly imprisoned**—only **forgotten**.

**Re-claiming is remembering**:

> *"I am not the Voice. I am the one listening to it."*

> *"The dragon guards my kingdom. I am not here to kill it. I am here to re-claim it."*
