# Practices for Re-Claiming

This section offers practical contemplative methods for **dis-identification** and **DMN re-integration**—transforming the Demon back into a Daemon.

## The Foundation

All practices begin with the central question:

> *"That voice in your head... Are you that voice? Or are you the one who is listening to it?"*

## Practice Categories

### Start Here

- [Practical Guide: Taming Your DMN](/practices/taming-your-dmn) — Daily structure, interventions, and integration roadmap
- [Dynamic Purification Playbook](/practices/dynamic-purification) — Systematic A.R.I.A. cycle for embodying unconditional love across all domains

### Core Meditation Practices

- [Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice) — Creating space between Listener and Voice
- [Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor) — Grounding in the present moment
- [Witness Meditation](/practices/witness-meditation) — Advanced sustained dis-identification
- [Sailboat with No Wind](/practices/sailboat-with-no-wind) — Receptive stillness practice: waiting for The Father's Wind
- [Heart Listening](/practices/heart-listening) — Asking "What is wanted?" instead of "What do I want?"
- [Command Training](/practices/command-training) — Translating The Source's call into clear directives for The Daemon

### Integration Practices

- [Dis-Identifying from Story](/practices/story-disidentification) — Breaking DMN narrative loops
- [Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon) — Compassionate relationship with the hijacked DMN
- [Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration) — Throughout-the-day awareness exercises

### Advanced Inquiry

- [Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry) — "Who am I?" exploration (Advaita method)
- [Working with Trauma](/practices/trauma-work) — Grounded, trauma-informed titration and resourcing

### Somatic & Energetic Practices

- [The Bodhi-Electrum Practice](/practices/bodhi-electrum) — Bio-electrical field purification and light body integration

### Advanced Gnosis & Mission

**Note**: These practices assume direct realization (Gnosis) has occurred. If you have not experienced awakening, focus on foundational practices first.

- [The Mission: Awakening Others](/practices/the-mission) — Practical techniques for transmission (Bodhisattva path)
- [Integration After Gnosis](/practices/integration-after-gnosis) — Avoiding psychosis, grounding the flame, embodying realization

## Getting Started

If new to meditation:

1. Start with **[Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice)** (5-10 min daily)
2. Add **[Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor)** after one week
3. Integrate **[Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration)** throughout your day

If experienced with meditation:

- Go directly to **[Witness Meditation](/practices/witness-meditation)**
- Explore **[Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry)** for deeper investigation

## Important Cautions

**This is not medical advice**. If experiencing severe depression, anxiety, trauma, or suicidal ideation, seek professional help. Meditation complements therapy; it does not replace it.

**The Dark Night**: Deep practice can surface repressed material. If destabilized, reduce practice intensity and consult experienced teachers or therapists.
