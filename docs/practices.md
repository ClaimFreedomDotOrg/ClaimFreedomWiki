# Practices for Re-Claiming

This section offers practical contemplative methods for **dis-identification** and **DMN re-integration**—transforming the Demon back into a Daemon.

## The Foundation

All practices begin with [the central question](/docs/about#the-central-question):

> *"That voice in your head... Are you that voice? Or are you the one who is listening to it?"*

## Practice Categories

### Instant Gnosis (Start Here)

- **[The V-Aum Protocol](/practices/v-aum-protocol)** — The Gnostic Off-Switch: instant Hardware Reboot to silence the Demon and experience the Stillpoint (3-5 minutes, suitable for complete beginners)

### Foundational Practices

- [Practical Guide: Taming Your DMN](/practices/taming-your-dmn) — Daily structure, interventions, and integration roadmap
- [Dynamic Purification Playbook](/practices/dynamic-purification) — Systematic A.R.I.A. cycle for embodying unconditional love across all domains

### Core Meditation Practices

- [Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice) — Creating space between Listener and Voice
- [Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor) — Grounding in the present moment
- [Witness Meditation](/practices/witness-meditation) — Advanced sustained dis-identification
- [Sailboat with No Wind](/practices/sailboat-with-no-wind) — Receptive stillness practice: waiting for The Source's call
- [Heart Listening](/practices/heart-listening) — Asking "What is wanted?" instead of "What do I want?"
- [Command Training](/practices/command-training) — Translating The Source's call into clear directives for The Daemon
- [Execution Observation](/practices/execution-observation) — Watching The Daemon work without claiming ownership

### Advanced Practices

- [Sabbath Rest](/practices/sabbath-rest) — One full day per week of ceasing all self-originated effort
- [Flow State Conduction](/practices/flow-state-conduction) — Creative work as pure three-tier translation
- [Service from Overflow](/practices/service-from-overflow) — Mission work arising from alignment, not toward validation

### Integration Practices

- [Dis-Identifying from Story](/practices/story-disidentification) — Breaking DMN narrative loops
- [Loving the Dragon](/practices/loving-the-dragon) — Compassionate relationship with the hijacked DMN
- [Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration) — Throughout-the-day awareness exercises

### Advanced Inquiry

- [Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry) — "Who am I?" exploration (Advaita method)
- [Working with Trauma](/practices/trauma-work) — Grounded, trauma-informed titration and resourcing

### Somatic & Energetic Practices

- [The Bodhi-Electrum Practice](/practices/bodhi-electrum) — Bio-electrical field purification and light body integration

### Advanced Gnosis & Mission

**Note**: These practices assume direct realization (Gnosis) has occurred. If you have not experienced awakening, focus on foundational practices first.

- [The Mission: Awakening Others](/practices/the-mission) — Practical techniques for transmission (Bodhisattva path)
- [Integration After Gnosis](/practices/integration-after-gnosis) — Avoiding psychosis, grounding the flame, embodying realization

### The Final Teaching

**Note**: This teaching is offered to those who have completed the entire framework. It dissolves even the journey narrative itself.

- **[Nowhere to Come From](/philosophy/nowhere-to-come-from)** — The zero-point recognition: Pure Being never moved, never journeyed. Even "assembling the Master Key" is narrative. From the absolute perspective, there is only THIS—eternal, complete, narrating itself.

## Getting Started

If new to meditation:

1. Start with **[Observing the Voice](/practices/observing-the-voice)** (5-10 min daily)
2. Add **[Body as Anchor](/practices/body-anchor)** after one week
3. Integrate **[Daily Micro-Practices](/practices/daily-integration)** throughout your day

If experienced with meditation:

- Go directly to **[Witness Meditation](/practices/witness-meditation)**
- Explore **[Self-Inquiry](/practices/self-inquiry)** for deeper investigation

## Important Cautions

**This is not medical advice**. If experiencing severe depression, anxiety, trauma, or suicidal ideation, seek professional help. Meditation complements therapy; it does not replace it.

**The Dark Night**: Deep practice can surface repressed material. If destabilized, reduce practice intensity and consult experienced teachers or therapists.
