## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in refining this neurophilosophical inquiry into the hijacked mind and the path to re-claiming.

### Ways to Contribute

- **Textual Analysis**: Deepen exegesis of Gnostic, Indigenous, or Eastern texts
- **Neuroscience Citations**: Add peer-reviewed research on DMN, meditation, neuroplasticity, epigenetics
- **Contemplative Practices**: Propose methods grounded in this framework
- **Clarity and Accessibility**: Improve explanations without sacrificing rigor
- **Constructive Critique**: Challenge assumptions, identify gaps, strengthen coherence

### Editing a Page

- On the site, use the "Edit this page" footer link
- In GitHub, click the pencil icon on a file to propose edits via Pull Request

### Content Guidelines

**Scholarly Rigor**:

- Cite sources for philosophical/spiritual claims (primary texts preferred)
- Link to peer-reviewed research for neuroscience/epigenetics claims
- Distinguish between established fact, hypothesis, and metaphor

**Tone and Clarity**:

- Prefer plain language; avoid unnecessary jargon
- Define specialized terms (e.g., DMN, Gnosis, Samsara) when first introduced
- Use short paragraphs, bullet lists, and headers for scannability

**Scope**:

- Stay anchored to the core framework: DMN hijacking, Gnostic/Indigenous diagnosis, dis-identification practice
- Avoid tangents unrelated to the central thesis
- If proposing new sections, explain how they connect to the Daemon/Demon distinction

**Balance**:

- Honor both ancient wisdom and modern science
- Avoid dogmatism: this is an inquiry, not a final doctrine
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties

### Contemplative Practice Contributions

When proposing practices:

- Ground them in traditional methods (Vipassana, Zen, Advaita, etc.) where applicable
- Explain the intended effect on the DMN or relationship to dis-identification
- Include cautions (e.g., trauma surfacing, need for professional support)
- Avoid proprietary or commercialized techniques

### Structure and Navigation

- Place general pages in `docs/`
- Use `nav_order` in front matter to control position (lower numbers first)
- Maintain heading hierarchy: one H1 (via page title), H2+ in content
- Link internally using relative paths: `[Part I](/docs/the-hijacking)`

### Code of Conduct

- Be respectful, constructive, and assume positive intent
- Disagreements are welcome; harassment is not
- This framework synthesizes diverse traditions—honor them with care
- Personal attacks, dogmatic assertions, or dismissive language will not be tolerated

### Review Process

1. Open a Pull Request with your proposed changes
2. Maintainers will review for alignment with scope, rigor, and tone
3. Discussion may occur in PR comments
4. Once consensus is reached, changes will be merged
