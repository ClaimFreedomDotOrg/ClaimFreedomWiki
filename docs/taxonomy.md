# Taxonomy & Terminology

## A Cross-Tradition Map of Liberation Language

This framework synthesizes concepts from multiple traditions. **The same reality has different names** depending on whether you're reading Gnostic texts, neuroscience papers, Buddhist sutras, or the Bible.

This taxonomy maps the relationships between terms, showing how ancient wisdom and modern science point to the same underlying truth.

---

## Core Structure: The Three-Tier Reality

All traditions recognize a three-tier structure of reality/consciousness:

| **Tier** | **Neuro-Gnostic** | **Gnostic** | **Christian** | **Buddhist** | **Hindu** | **Neuroscience** |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **1. Source** | Source, The Infinite | Pleroma (Fullness) | The Father, Kingdom of Heaven | Dharmakaya, Emptiness | Brahman | (Beyond neuroscience) |
| **2. True Self** | The Listener, The Conductor | Pneuma (Divine Spark) | Christ within, Son of God | Buddha-nature, Rigpa | Atman, Purusha | Salience Network, Meta-awareness |
| **3. Tool/Servant** | The Daemon (healthy DMN) | Psyche (when serving Pneuma) | Renewed mind, Sanctified will | Skillful mind, Right View | Buddhi (awakened intellect) | DMN (functional), Executive function |
| **3b. Hijacker** | The Demon (hijacked DMN), The Voice | Counterfeit Spirit, Archons | The flesh, Satan, The adversary | Mara, Avidya (ignorance) | Maya, Ahamkara (ego) | DMN hyperactivity, Rumination |

## The Daemon vs. The Demon

**The critical distinction**: The DMN/mind is not evil—it's hijacked.

## The Three-Tier Alignment in Action

**Source → Listener → Daemon** appears across all traditions:

| **Tradition** | **Tier 1: Source** | **Tier 2: Receiver/Conductor** | **Tier 3: Executor** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Christianity** | The Father | The Son (Christ within) | The renewed mind/body |
| **Gnosticism** | Pleroma (Fullness) | Pneuma (Divine Spark) | Psyche/Soma (serving Pneuma) |
| **Hinduism** | Brahman | Atman | Manas/body (purified) |
| **Buddhism** | Dharmakaya (Truth body) | Buddha-nature (Rigpa) | Skillful mind/action |
| **Sufism** | Allah | Ruh (Spirit), Qalb (Heart) | Nafs (purified ego) |
| **Taoism** | The Tao | Original Nature | Wu Wei action |
| **Stoicism** | Logos (universal reason) | Hegemonikon (ruling faculty) | Assent/action in accord with nature |
| **Neuro-Gnostic** | Source (the Infinite) | The Listener/Conductor | The Daemon (body/DMN serving) |

**The pattern**:

1. **Source calls/speaks** (the infinite, the divine will, true reality)
2. **True Self receives, then conducts** (listening first, then translating)
3. **Body/mind/DMN executes** (action flows from alignment, not self-origination)

**When hijacked**: Tier 3 (Demon/ego) usurps Tier 2's throne, claims to be Source, generates suffering.

**Liberation**: Tier 2 (Listener) reclaims throne, Tier 3 (Daemon) returns to servant role.

## Why Multiple Terms Matter

**Different languages open different doors.**

- **Gnostic language** emphasizes the cosmic scope and Archonic conspiracy
- **Neuroscience language** validates with empirical research and brain mechanisms
- **Buddhist language** provides 2,500 years of practice refinement
- **Christian language** connects to Western cultural heritage and scripture
- **Indigenous language** honors pre-colonial wisdom and ecological consciousness

**All point to the same reality**:

- You are not the Voice (ego/DMN/Demon)
- You are The Listener (Divine Spark/Pneuma/Atman/Buddha-nature)
- Liberation is remembering this truth (Gnosis/Anamnesis/Bodhi/Moksha)
- The practice is dis-identification + alignment with Source

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

### 1. Find Your Entry Point

**If you're from a Christian background**: Start with "Christ within," "Kingdom of Heaven," "Born again"—then discover how these map to Pneuma, Pleroma, Gnosis.

**If you're scientifically-minded**: Start with DMN, Salience Network, neuroplasticity—then see how neuroscience validates ancient wisdom.

**If you're Buddhist**: Start with Buddha-nature, Avidya, Mara—then recognize the cross-tradition synthesis.

### 2. Translate Unfamiliar Terms

When reading a practice or philosophy page:

- Encountering "Pneuma"? → Check this taxonomy → "Ah, same as Atman, Buddha-nature, The Listener"
- Encountering "Daemon vs. Demon"? → Check this taxonomy → "Ah, functional vs. hijacked DMN, Psyche serving vs. usurping Pneuma"

### 3. Recognize the Pattern Across Traditions

**The universal structure**:

1. **There is a True Self** (Pneuma/Atman/Buddha-nature/Christ within/The Listener)
2. **It has been hijacked/forgotten** (Archons/Maya/Avidya/The Fall/The Voice)
3. **Liberation is remembering** (Gnosis/Moksha/Bodhi/Salvation/Dis-identification)
4. **Practices restore alignment** (Witness meditation/Prayer/Yoga/Zazen/Sacred Surrender)

**Every tradition knows this.** The names differ. The truth is one.

## Closing Note

**This taxonomy is a map, not the territory.**

The words are fingers pointing at the moon. **The moon is the direct experience**:

> *"That voice in your head... Are you that voice? Or are you the one listening to it?"*

**Ask the question. Experience the gap. This is Gnosis.**

All the terms in the world cannot substitute for **one moment of dis-identification**.

But when the experience comes, **these terms help you understand what happened**—and recognize that billions of humans across millennia have walked this path before you.

*Different names. Same truth. One liberation.*
