## Invocation: The Anti-Corruption Axiom

> *"That voice in your head... Are you that voice? Or are you the one who is listening to it?"*

I'm going to ask you to set aside everything you think you know and just listen.

I am not here to share a "theory." I am here to tell you the truth.

You have been hi-jacked.

Your body, your mind, your entire society has been hi-jacked by a parasitic infection.

This is not an allegory. It is a fact.

This infection is the root cause of all of it. Every disease, every bit of pain, every moment of suffering, every war, every addiction, every argument... it is a symptom of this infection.

And it is keeping you sick, and it is keeping you asleep.

The greatest lie we've ever been told is that "this is human nature." That we are inherently flawed, violent, or greedy.

This is false.

The true nature of Humanity is peace and love.

But we are stuck. We are stuck in a repetitive loop of self-destruction. Our society rises, and then it implodes. We have been attempting to recover and rebuild from this loop for a very, very long time.

How do I know? Because we are our ancestors.

We are the same energy signatures, the same souls, the same minds... being reincarnated over and over, stuck in an eternal loop of what every religion in history has called "hell."

And every prophet, every mystic, every ancient philosophy... they all left us clues about this. They were all warning us.

Now, how is this possible?

Because you are not your body. Your mind, your consciousness, your "Divine Spark," exists outside this physical realm. The body is just a vessel. A vehicle for us to interact in this shared space.

And because your true Self is divine and immortal, this infection... this parasite... it cannot harm your soul.

It can only influence you.

And it does that through two weapons: your Ignorance and your Naivety.

It has found a backdoor. It has found a "demon" inside your own vessel.

The Gnostic texts warned us about this. They said the "demon" is inside us.

And today, we know its name.

It is the Default Mode Network. The DMN.

**DEMON = DMN.**

But here is the Gnosis. Here is the secret. A "Daemon," in the original sense, is not "evil." In computer science, a "daemon" is simply a background process. It's neutral.

Your DMN... your "Ego"... is just a background process. It's supposed to work for you.

But it has been hi-jacked. It has been corrupted to work against you.

It's the voice in your head that never stops talking. It ruminates on the Past---which is the trauma of your ancestors, your past lives, this endless loop of hell. And it generates anxiety about the Future---the next societal implosion.

It has been turned into a "dragon" that is guarding your own "kingdom."

All the ancient stories told us the path.

We must go inside the "Cave."

We must conquer the "Dragon."

And we must tame it.

You are not here to kill your DMN. You are here to re-claim it. To make it work for you and restore balance to your "Kingdom."

This is what the prophets were trying to rally us to do. This is the great challenge.

Because if we do this, if we awaken from this ignorance, we will stop being sick. We will stop dying from "dis-ease" and we will experience what they called "eternal life."

Immortality doesn't mean you can't be destroyed. It means you have the possibility of sustaining indefinitely... with proper balance, maintenance, and awareness.

We can break the loop.

It all starts with you, inside your own mind. You have to see the hi-jacker.

So I will ask you the question that begins the awakening.

That voice in your head... the one that's been talking this entire time, telling you what you think about what I'm saying...

Are you that voice?

...Or are you the one who is listening to it?
