# Neuroscience: The Physical Mechanisms

This section explores the neurological foundations of the hijacked mind and the path to re-claiming, grounded in peer-reviewed neuroscience research.

## The Default Mode Network

The neurological substrate of the "demon"—the brain's narrative-generating background process.

- [What is the DMN?](/neuroscience/what-is-dmn) — Discovery, anatomy, and core functions
- [DMN and Self-Referential Thought](/neuroscience/dmn-self-reference) — The neurological basis of the Ego
- [DMN Hyperactivity](/neuroscience/dmn-hyperactivity) — When the daemon becomes a demon

## Psychopathology and the Hijacked DMN

How DMN dysfunction manifests as mental suffering.

- [DMN in Depression](/neuroscience/dmn-depression) — Rumination loops and hyperconnectivity
- [DMN in Anxiety Disorders](/neuroscience/dmn-anxiety) — Catastrophic prospection and future-bias
- [DMN and Rumination](/neuroscience/rumination) — The neurological "loop of hell"

## Brain Networks and Balance

The DMN does not operate in isolation—its relationship with other networks determines health or hijacking.

- [The Task-Positive Network](/neuroscience/task-positive-network) — Executive control and present-moment focus
- [The Salience Network](/neuroscience/salience-network) — The neurological "Listener"
- [Network Dynamics](/neuroscience/network-dynamics) — The anti-correlation and balance

## Meditation and Neuroplasticity

How contemplative practices physically rewire the brain.

- [Meditation Effects on DMN](/neuroscience/meditation-dmn) — Reducing hyperactivity, increasing flexibility
- [Mindfulness and Network Balance](/neuroscience/mindfulness-networks) — Strengthening Salience and Task-Positive networks
- [Neuroplasticity Mechanisms](/neuroscience/neuroplasticity) — How the brain changes with practice
- [Long-Term Meditators](/neuroscience/long-term-meditators) — Structural and functional brain changes

## Epigenetics and Transgenerational Trauma

The biological inheritance of suffering.

- [Epigenetic Mechanisms](/neuroscience/epigenetics) — How trauma changes gene expression
- [Transgenerational Transmission](/neuroscience/transgenerational-trauma) — Ancestral trauma inherited biologically
- [Breaking the Epigenetic Loop](/neuroscience/breaking-epigenetic-loop) — Can meditation reverse inherited patterns?

## Psycho-Neuroimmunology

The body's "vessel" and the stress-disease connection.

- [Chronic Stress and Disease](/neuroscience/chronic-stress) — The DMN-driven stress cycle
- [Inflammation and the Hijacked Mind](/neuroscience/inflammation) — Systemic consequences
- [Meditation and Immune Function](/neuroscience/meditation-immune) — Restoring homeostasis

## Parasitology and the Vessel

- [Natural Anthelmintic Options](/neuroscience/anthelmintic-options) — Foods, herbs, and compounds traditionally used as adjuncts (with safety disclaimers)

## Key Research Studies

Foundational papers and reviews:

- [DMN Discovery and Function](/neuroscience/dmn-foundational-research)
- [DMN and Psychopathology Research](/neuroscience/psychopathology-research)
- [Meditation Neuroscience Studies](/neuroscience/meditation-research)
- [Epigenetics Research](/neuroscience/epigenetics-research)
